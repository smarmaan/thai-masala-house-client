1. Add an about us page

1. If you have time, try implementing a dark/light theme toggle. 


3. Add something extra of your own. This will help you in the future to differentiate your project from others.

4. If you want to take a challenge. Consider using `react-leaflet` anywhere in your application

### Additional information:

1. You can use a local image or host image anywhere or use pictures from the internet. And it's ok if you have the image url, but the image link doesn't work. 
2. You can use vanilla CSS or any CSS library (Bootstrap, tailwind) you want. If you wish, you can use both Bootstrap and react-bootstrap. Also, if you want, you can use any tailwind component library such as DaisyUI, etc.
3. Try to host your site on Firebase (Netlify hosting will need some extra configurations)
4. Host your server-side application on Vercel. If needed, you can host somewhere else as well.
4. Make Sure you deploy server-side and client-side on the first day. If you have any issues with hosting or GitHub push, please join the "Github and deploy" related support session.

### What to submit:

1. Your client-side code GitHub repository
2. Your server-side code GitHub repository
3. Your live website link

### Some Guidelines:

1. Do not waste much time on the website idea. Just spend 15-20 minutes deciding, find a sample website, and start working on it.
2. Do not waste much time finding the right image. You can always start with a simple idea. Make the website and then add different images.
3. Don't look at the overall task list. Just take one task at a time and do it. Once it's done, pick the next task. If you get stuck on a particular task, move on to the next task.
4. Stay calm, think before coding, and work sequentially. You will make it.
5. Be strategic about the electricity issue. 
6. use `chatgpt` to generate JSON data. You can use chatGPT for Yother purposes as well.
